Important Info:
- Look at console to see account details in order to log in
- All dummy accounts have a password of password123
- When the pages get reloaded, accounts that are using dummy data will overwrite changes made on reload
- The sign up page is functional, so if you want to test an account that wont change on refresh, you can make an account through sign up.
- The page uses system theme preference as the colour scheme
- There is a tests folder, which hold the 5 unit tests. Please use npm run test to run the unit tests.
